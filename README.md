# dedsecskullbash
WATCH_DOGS // Dedsec skull ASCII art terminal project.

<h2> Usage </h2>

1. Install Greenscreen font
2. Change Terminal font to Greenscreen
3. `cd dedsecskull`
4. `./lbl.sh dedsec.txt`
5. Alternatively you can do what I've done and make that command an alias:

e.g.
inside `.bashrc` do:
`alias dednom='./lbl.sh dedsec.txt'` *
Save and exit, then run from your terminal
*where dednom is the alias you wish to use.

<h3> Why to use Greenscreen font </h3>
For some reason Greenscreen looks and formats the skull correctly so it doesn't look too thin in terms of width, for accuracy that's the font I went with to ensure it wouldn't look "off".

Enjoy!! <3
