# dedsecskullbash
WATCH_DOGS // Dedsec skull ASCII art terminal project.

<h2> Usage </h2>
In the Releases tab, download dedsecskull.zip and extract it.

  - Install Greenscreen font
  - Change Terminal font to Greenscreen
  - `cd dedsecskull`
  - `./lbl.sh dedsec.txt`
  
 Alternatively you can do what I've done and make that command an alias:

e.g.
- inside `.bashrc` do:
- `alias dednom='./lbl.sh dedsec.txt'` *
- Save and exit, then run from your terminal
- *where dednom is the alias you wish to use.

<h3> Why to use Greenscreen font </h3>
For some reason Greenscreen looks and formats the skull correctly so it doesn't look too thin in terms of width, for accuracy that's the font I went with to ensure it wouldn't look "off".

Enjoy!! <3
